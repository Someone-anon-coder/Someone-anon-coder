# 👋 Hi, I’m @Someone-anon-coder

### 👀 About Me
I’m an **implementation-oriented programmer** with a passion for hands-on experimentation and real-world problem-solving. My approach to programming focuses on creating practical, functional solutions using code, emphasizing **real-world applications** over theoretical exploration.

I’m skilled in several programming languages, including **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **PHP**, **SQL**, **Java**, and **AutoHotkey**, and I'm particularly interested in **machine learning** and **AI**.

### 🌱 What I’m Currently Working On
I'm currently working on a project called **AI Ecosystem**, where the goal is to create an advanced **PC assistant** capable of performing any tasks a human can execute via a computer. This involves building models for **reinforcement learning** and expanding my knowledge into the field of **cybersecurity**, focusing on AI solutions to combat modern-day cyber threats.

### 💡 Past Projects
Some of the projects I've developed include:
- **Tic-tac-toe playing agent**: A simple AI agent that plays Tic-tac-toe.
- **Maze-solving agent**: A reinforcement learning-based agent that finds its way through mazes.
- **Sentiment analyzer**: A tool using natural language processing to analyze and classify text sentiment.
- **Object detection model**: Implementation of a YOLO-like object detection system with custom models.

### 💞️ Collaboration
I’m looking to collaborate on:
- **AI-driven solutions** for both **machine learning** and **cybersecurity**.
- Projects focused on **reinforcement learning** and **AI-driven automation**.
- **Open-source AI tools** to make intelligent systems more accessible to the community.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I thrive on exploring how **AI** can solve complex, real-world problems—especially in areas that involve **learning from data** and automating processes. Outside of coding, I’m fascinated by how technology can be used to secure the digital world against evolving cyber threats.
